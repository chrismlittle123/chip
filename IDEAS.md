How to eliminate context switches:1. Front-load ALL decisions in architect modeBefore ANY code is written, you specify EVERYTHING:
YOUR ARCHITECTURE SESSION (30-60 mins):
├─ What we're building (user auth system)
├─ Technology decisions (JWT, refresh tokens, Redis for blacklist)
├─ Quality requirements (100% test coverage, security audit)
├─ Edge cases to handle (concurrent logins, token rotation)
├─ Integration points (existing user model, API structure)
└─ Definition of "done" (deployed, documented, reviewed)The agent should NEVER come back with questions. If your spec was complete, it has everything it needs.

The agent should NEVER come back with questions. If your spec was complete, it has everything it needs.



AGENT WORKFLOW (runs without you):
1. Generate code
2. Run tests (must pass)
3. Run linter (must pass)  
4. Security scan (must pass)
5. Style check against YOUR patterns
6. Self-review against YOUR quality bar
7. Only THEN surface to you



Morning session (2 hours):
├─ Design feature A (30 min)
├─ Design feature B (30 min)  
├─ Design feature C (30 min)
└─ Design feature D (30 min)

Agent works on all 4 in parallel

Evening session (1 hour):
└─ Review all 4 at once at architecture level



The Golden Rule:
If the agent asks you a question, you failed at the architecture phase.




ARCHITECT SESSION (3 hours, uninterrupted):

Hour 1: Architecture & Spec
- Design 3-5 features in detail
- Write complete specs
- Define success criteria
- Start agent execution

Hour 2-3: Continue architecting NEXT batch
- You're always thinking ahead
- Never waiting for code
- Always in architect mode

REVIEW SESSION (separate, 1 hour):
- Review completed work at high level
- Approve or request changes
- Update style guide based on learnings



Reality check: During long sessions, Claude's context window can fill with irrelevant conversation and file contents, reducing performance Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding. You'll need mechanisms to detect and recover from this.Your solution:

Build a "stuck detection" system (no progress for X minutes)
Queue these for your review inbox (not interrupting)
Or: Agent spawns a subagent to debug while continuing other work


Problem 2: Confidence ≠ Correctness
AI confidently writes broken code claiming it's great A staff engineer's 6-week journey with Claude Code.
3 hours is a LONG time for code to accumulate without validation.
Your solution:

Automated test suites must be comprehensive
Agent runs tests continuously
Only surfaces code that passes ALL gates
But: You need to trust your test suite completely

Problem 3: The amnesia problem compounds
AI doesn't learn from mistakes, so you fix the same misunderstandings repeatedly A staff engineer's 6-week journey with Claude Code.
Over 3 hours, it might make the same architectural mistake in features C and D that you corrected in feature A.
Your solution:

After each completed feature, extract learnings
Update style guide automatically
Inject recent learnings into subsequent tasks
This is novel - no one's really solved this well yet

Problem 4: Your specs won't be perfect at first
You think you can specify everything upfront, but:

You'll forget edge cases
Requirements will be ambiguous
Your style guide won't cover every scenario

Reality: First 20-30 sessions will be rough. You'll discover:

"Oh, I need to specify error handling patterns"
"Oh, I need to document my state management philosophy"
"Oh, I need to explain when to extract utilities"

Your solution:

Expect a 2-3 month calibration period
Every gap discovered → update style guide
Track "questions asked" metric → should trend to zero
This IS realistic, just not immediate



What's realistic TODAY:
✅ 30-60 min uninterrupted architect sessions
✅ Agent completes 1-2 well-specified features independently
✅ 80-90% of implementation done without you
✅ Async review cycles
✅ Continuous improvement of style guide



CREATE YOUR OWN TAILOR-MADE FORMAT
Here's why this is the ONLY path that works:
1. You have unique requirements
Your specs need to be:

✅ Complete enough for Claude Code (no ambiguity)
✅ Aligned with YOUR coding style (not generic)
✅ Fast to write with Chip's help (not 50 pages)
✅ Readable by YOU for review (not pure code)



BUILD HOOKS OR WAYS TO CHECK THAT SPEC IS MET AND STYLE IS ENFORCED. OPTION TO LIMIT THIS TO ONLY THE FILES THAT YOU WROTE IN A REPO???

Claude Code's Job:


✅ Execute the spec exactly as written
✅ Stop immediately when hitting a blocker
✅ Report the blocker clearly
❌ DO NOT try to "figure it out"
❌ DO NOT make creative decisions
❌ DO NOT use alternative approaches

My Recommendation: Tab-Based with Review Queue

1. Spec Mode Tab (Default, where you spend 80% of time):


2. Review Mode Tab (Switch when ready):



Phase 1: THINKING (E-ink device, walking around)
  ↓
Phase 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Terminal/Claude Code, at desk)

Phase 3: REVIEW (??? - let's figure this out)




WHAT ABOUT JUST GENERAL DISCOVERY, NOT BUILDING???? OR THINGS LIKE MORE DATA SCIENCE/ML ENGINEER WORK? How about we crack software engineering work first! then it should become more obvious with time.
