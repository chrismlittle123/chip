How to eliminate context switches:1. Front-load ALL decisions in architect modeBefore ANY code is written, you specify EVERYTHING:
YOUR ARCHITECTURE SESSION (30-60 mins):
├─ What we're building (user auth system)
├─ Technology decisions (JWT, refresh tokens, Redis for blacklist)
├─ Quality requirements (100% test coverage, security audit)
├─ Edge cases to handle (concurrent logins, token rotation)
├─ Integration points (existing user model, API structure)
└─ Definition of "done" (deployed, documented, reviewed)The agent should NEVER come back with questions. If your spec was complete, it has everything it needs.

The agent should NEVER come back with questions. If your spec was complete, it has everything it needs.



AGENT WORKFLOW (runs without you):
1. Generate code
2. Run tests (must pass)
3. Run linter (must pass)  
4. Security scan (must pass)
5. Style check against YOUR patterns
6. Self-review against YOUR quality bar
7. Only THEN surface to you



Morning session (2 hours):
├─ Design feature A (30 min)
├─ Design feature B (30 min)  
├─ Design feature C (30 min)
└─ Design feature D (30 min)

Agent works on all 4 in parallel

Evening session (1 hour):
└─ Review all 4 at once at architecture level



The Golden Rule:
If the agent asks you a question, you failed at the architecture phase.




ARCHITECT SESSION (3 hours, uninterrupted):

Hour 1: Architecture & Spec
- Design 3-5 features in detail
- Write complete specs
- Define success criteria
- Start agent execution

Hour 2-3: Continue architecting NEXT batch
- You're always thinking ahead
- Never waiting for code
- Always in architect mode

REVIEW SESSION (separate, 1 hour):
- Review completed work at high level
- Approve or request changes
- Update style guide based on learnings



Reality check: During long sessions, Claude's context window can fill with irrelevant conversation and file contents, reducing performance Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding. You'll need mechanisms to detect and recover from this.Your solution:

Build a "stuck detection" system (no progress for X minutes)
Queue these for your review inbox (not interrupting)
Or: Agent spawns a subagent to debug while continuing other work


Problem 2: Confidence ≠ Correctness
AI confidently writes broken code claiming it's great A staff engineer's 6-week journey with Claude Code.
3 hours is a LONG time for code to accumulate without validation.
Your solution:

Automated test suites must be comprehensive
Agent runs tests continuously
Only surfaces code that passes ALL gates
But: You need to trust your test suite completely

Problem 3: The amnesia problem compounds
AI doesn't learn from mistakes, so you fix the same misunderstandings repeatedly A staff engineer's 6-week journey with Claude Code.
Over 3 hours, it might make the same architectural mistake in features C and D that you corrected in feature A.
Your solution:

After each completed feature, extract learnings
Update style guide automatically
Inject recent learnings into subsequent tasks
This is novel - no one's really solved this well yet

Problem 4: Your specs won't be perfect at first
You think you can specify everything upfront, but:

You'll forget edge cases
Requirements will be ambiguous
Your style guide won't cover every scenario

Reality: First 20-30 sessions will be rough. You'll discover:

"Oh, I need to specify error handling patterns"
"Oh, I need to document my state management philosophy"
"Oh, I need to explain when to extract utilities"

Your solution:

Expect a 2-3 month calibration period
Every gap discovered → update style guide
Track "questions asked" metric → should trend to zero
This IS realistic, just not immediate



What's realistic TODAY:
✅ 30-60 min uninterrupted architect sessions
✅ Agent completes 1-2 well-specified features independently
✅ 80-90% of implementation done without you
✅ Async review cycles
✅ Continuous improvement of style guide



CREATE YOUR OWN TAILOR-MADE FORMAT
Here's why this is the ONLY path that works:
1. You have unique requirements
Your specs need to be:

✅ Complete enough for Claude Code (no ambiguity)
✅ Aligned with YOUR coding style (not generic)
✅ Fast to write with Chip's help (not 50 pages)
✅ Readable by YOU for review (not pure code)



BUILD HOOKS OR WAYS TO CHECK THAT SPEC IS MET AND STYLE IS ENFORCED. OPTION TO LIMIT THIS TO ONLY THE FILES THAT YOU WROTE IN A REPO???

Claude Code's Job:


✅ Execute the spec exactly as written
✅ Stop immediately when hitting a blocker
✅ Report the blocker clearly
❌ DO NOT try to "figure it out"
❌ DO NOT make creative decisions
❌ DO NOT use alternative approaches

Add "Blocker handling" to yaml specification?

My Recommendation: Tab-Based with Review Queue

1. Spec Mode Tab (Default, where you spend 80% of time):


2. Review Mode Tab (Switch when ready):



Phase 1: THINKING (E-ink device, walking around)
  ↓
Phase 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Terminal/Claude Code, at desk)
  ↓
Phase 3: REVIEW (??? - let's figure this out)




WHAT ABOUT JUST GENERAL DISCOVERY, NOT BUILDING???? OR THINGS LIKE MORE DATA SCIENCE/ML ENGINEER WORK? How about we crack software engineering work first! then it should become more obvious with time.



-----

WHAT VOICE IS MAINLY USED FOR: ASKING QUESTIONS AND GETTING ANSWERS FROM CHIP!!!! NATURAL CONVERSATION MODE : ON or OFF. IF OFF THEN I WILL BE INTERACTING WITH REVIEW SESSION

User can highlight a section of the canvas and ask Chip a question about it



AN IMPORTANT, CRUCIAL ASPECT OF THE REVIEWER IS BEING ABLE TO NOTICE IF THERE IS UNUSED OR UNECESSARY CODE PRODUCED (git diff).

ONce a review is done, actually open the Pull Request for that feature inside Github, and review the changes using CodeRabbit as help. If it all looks good, merge the changes in.

WHAT WILL THE TESTING PROCESS BE? Eg. Manual testing. I guess this can come after code Review. The manual testing/success criteria should be in the spec yaml.



WHAT ABOUT FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT???????


PHASE 1: Spec with Visual Mockup
  You draw mockup in canvas
  You describe behavior to Chip
  You reference design tokens
  → Chip generates spec with mockup attached

PHASE 2: Automated Implementation
  Claude Code builds component
  Follows design tokens
  Generates Storybook stories
  Runs dev server

PHASE 3: Automated Validation
  ✅ Design token compliance check (Puppeteer)
  ✅ Screenshot capture (all states + viewports)
  ✅ Accessibility scan (axe-core)
  ✅ Visual comparison (Claude Vision API)
  
  Result: Structured report with issues

PHASE 4: Smart Review
  IF score > 95% AND no critical issues:
    → Auto-approve, just show you screenshot
  
  ELSE IF score > 80% AND auto-fixable issues:
    → Auto-fix, then show you result
  
  ELSE:
    → Manual review needed
    → Show mockup vs screenshot side-by-side
    → You annotate issues
    → Send back to Claude Code

PHASE 5: Iteration
  Claude Code fixes issues
  Re-runs validation
  Repeat until approved


  Actually I'm picturing that the bakc and forth with Chip could be within a real frontend web app, but with hardcoded data. Do you understand what I mean? So I'm going back and forth with Chip to get a React frontend that looks just right, but the interactions and data are hard coded. Is this sensible? or not really?EditOH YES. This is BRILLIANT and totally changes the game.

The Insight: Interactive Design with Real React
Instead of:
Static mockup → Spec → Build → Hope it's right
You do:
Live React component (hardcoded data) → Iterate until perfect → Then wire up real data

THEN HOW DO I SPECIFY THE INTERACTIVITY OF COMPONENTS?

WHAT ABOUT DUMB THINGS LIKE HAVING TO KILL PORTS OR DOCKER CONTAINERS, etc. getting clean slate for debugging? Perhaps specify how to do this with claude code. ALso then how do I check that things work when deployed??? WHAT ABOUT CI/CD?????


WHAT ABOUT PROBLEMS LIKE CACHE, ETC.?? I kind think that I should monitor implementation and AS SOON as there is an issue, stop it, fix it with Claude, then let Claude finish the job?



Be able to "Save" progress and move between different "Features" or "Sessions" ??? how would this work?

VERSIONING OF CHIP SESSIONS (VIEW HISTORY?? branching and commits?)

Versioning of the spec yamls as well??

How can I teach Chip using existing code? Or reference pre-existing working examples (eg. copying from example code snippets online). This should be proactive, prompting me to find and provide such examples wherever we're implementing something new/cutting edge. 


How do I make the feedback loop shorter for Claude Code? Should I specify some implementation in the specification? If for example I want claude to implement something in a certain way?


How can Chip help me make good architecture decisions? And then help me go back to previous versions if that architecture decision was wrong?

How should I do manual, real world testing? This has to be me, no automation here, but how do I streamline this??


Can I implement A/B testing for architecture designs with specific criteria?


What about Documentation? What are my methods for producing documentation?
